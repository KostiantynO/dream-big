**My Big Dream for 2026:**
1.	The Laptop is my tool and God is my word (Holy code).
2.	I created and helped to create 100 sites (HTML, CSS, JS) with total views 100,000,000 and active users count 1,000,000, that work for people even when I sleep or dead (24/7/366 with reliability 99.999% of the time avg per year).
3.	I work-Online.
4.	I'm Senior FullStack Dev making 6000 USD/month netto.
5.	I'm a part of a big company, leading a big team, that won a big project and succeed!

**Important to me:**
1.	Ground = mother-nature, all things (BTS/eNodeB) are connected to it.
2.	Tree = limited time & order (high-valued priorities are at the :root).

**To realize this dream, I need:**
a.  Time - 5 years to implement.
b.  Cash - 1000 USD/month for life to start.
c.	Edu - to learn HTML, CSS, JS to the point, when I can provide value for other people.
